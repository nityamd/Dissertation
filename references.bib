	Abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We construct a large, deep (Ks {\textless} 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of ÏÎz/(1+z) = 0.008 at i+ {\textless} 22.5 and ÏÎz/(1+z) = 0.03 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and starforming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being ``quenched'' in galaxies more massive than M 1010.7â10.9M . For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z {\textless} 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z âŒ 3 to z âŒ 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z âŒ 3 and z âŒ 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z {\textless} 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z {\textless} 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010â10.5M galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.},

@article{muzzin_evolution_2013,
	Abstract = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 Ks-selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z âŒ 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as Ïstar â (1 + z)â4.7$\pm$0.4 since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as Ïstar â (1 + z)â2.3$\pm$0.2. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(Mstar/M ) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(Mstar/M ) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

@article{moustakas_primus:_2013,
	Abstract = {We measure the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) from z = 0--1 using multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From PRIMUS we construct an i {\textless} 23 flux-limited sample of âŒ40,000 galaxies at z = 0.2--1.0 over five fields totaling â5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select âŒ170,000 galaxies at z = 0.01--0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a â30\% increase in the number density of âŒ1010 M galaxies since z â 0.6, and a 10\% change in the number density of all 1011 M galaxies since z â 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of âŒ1010 M star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z â 0.6, whereas the space density of 1011 M star-forming galaxies decreases by â50\% between z â 1 and z â 0. Meanwhile, the number density of âŒ1010 M quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of âŒ2--3 since z â 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z â 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around âŒ1010.8 M . In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z {\textless} 1, even among massive ( 1011 M ) quiescent galaxies.},

@article{tomczak_galaxy_2014,
	Abstract = {Using observations from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE), we obtain the deepest measurements to date of the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) at 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3. ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1--2 ÎŒm. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of âŒ109.5 M at z âŒ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses {\textless}1010 M that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z âŒ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (Mâ) and slope at the lowest masses (Î±) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M ) âŒ 10.65 and âŒâ1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M ) has increased by a factor of âŒ12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of âŒ2.2.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 Ã 105 and 2 Ã 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 AË across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 AË for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 AË to 160 Âµm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour--magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 4. We construct a large, deep (Ks $<$ 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometric redshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of $\sigma\Delta$z/(1+z) = 0.008 at i+ $<$ 22.5 and $\sigma\Delta$z/(1+z) = 0.03 at 1.5 $<$ z $<$ 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and starforming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being ``quenched'' in galaxies more massive than M 1010.7-10.9M . For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z $<$ 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z $\sim$ 3 to z $\sim$ 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z $\sim$ 3 and z $\sim$ 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z $<$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $<$ 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $>$ 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010-10.5M galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 $<$ z $<$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.},

From PRIMUS we construct an i $<$ 23 flux-limited sample of $\sim$40,000 galaxies at z = 0.2\textendash{}1.0 over five fields totaling $\approx$5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select $\sim$170,000 galaxies at z = 0.01\textendash{}0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a $\approx$30\% increase in the number density of $\sim$1010 M galaxies since z $\approx$ 0.6, and a 10\% change in the number density of all 1011 M galaxies since z $\approx$ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of $\sim$1010 M star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z $\approx$ 0.6, whereas the space density of 1011 M star-forming galaxies decreases by $\approx$50\% between z $\approx$ 1 and z $\approx$ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of $\sim$1010 M quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of $\sim$2\textendash{}3 since z $\approx$ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z $\approx$ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around $\sim$1010.8 M . In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z $<$ 1, even among massive ( 1011 M ) quiescent galaxies.},

ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1\textendash{}2 $\mu$m. We combine this with Hubble Space Telescope imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses of $\sim$109.5 M at z $\sim$ 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z 1.5 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the SMF, leading to an upturn at masses $<$1010 M that is not well described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z $\sim$ 2 and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M${_\ast}$) and slope at the lowest masses ($\alpha$) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/M ) $\sim$ 10.65 and $\sim$-1.5, respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. Our data allow us, for the first time, to observe a rapid buildup at the low-mass end of the quiescent SMF. Since z = 2.5, the total stellar mass density of quiescent galaxies (down to 109 M ) has increased by a factor of $\sim$12, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies only increases by a factor of $\sim$2.2.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A\r{} to 160 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour\textendash{}magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We extend the phenomenological study of the evolving galaxy population of Peng et al. (2010) to the central/satellite dichotomy in Yang et al. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) groups. We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency $\epsilon$sat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, $\delta$, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity $\delta$, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng et al. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M${_\ast}$ is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M${_\ast}$ for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 M , which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng et al. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25\%.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic ``dark ages'' to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z $\approx$ 1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than $\sim$1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

  abstract = {We explore the redshift evolution of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) for galaxies of different stellar mass by drawing on a deep 3.6 $\mu$m selected sample of $>$105 galaxies in the 2 deg2 COSMOS field. The average star formation rate (SFR) for subsets of these galaxies is estimated with stacked 1.4 GHz radio continuum emission. We separately consider the total sample and a subset of galaxies that shows evidence for substantive recent star formation in the rest-frame optical spectral energy distributions. At redshifts 0.2 $<$ z $<$ 3 both populations show a strong and mass-independent decrease in their SSFR toward the present epoch. It is best described by a power law (1 + z)n, where n $\sim$ 4.3 for all galaxies and n $\sim$ 3.5 for star-forming (SF) sources. The decrease appears to have started at z $>$ 2, at least for high-mass (M${_\ast}$ 4 \texttimes{} 1010 M ) systems where our conclusions are most robust. Our data show that there is a tight correlation with power-law dependence, SSFR $\propto$ M${_\ast}\beta$, between SSFR and stellar mass at all epochs. The relation tends to flatten below M${_\ast}$ $\approx$ 1010 M if quiescent galaxies are included; if they are excluded from the analysis a shallow index $\beta$SFG $\approx$ -0.4 fits the correlation. On average, higher mass objects always have lower SSFRs, also among SF galaxies. At z $>$ 1.5 there is tentative evidence for an upper threshold in SSFR that an average galaxy cannot exceed, possibly due to gravitationally limited molecular gas accretion. It is suggested by a flattening of the SSFR\textendash{}M${_\ast}$ relation (also for SF sources), but affects massive ($>$1010 M ) galaxies only at the highest redshifts. Since z = 1.5 there thus is no direct evidence that galaxies of higher mass experience a more rapid waning of their SSFR than lower mass SF systems. In this sense, the data rule out any strong ``downsizing'' in the SSFR. We combine our results with recent measurements of the galaxy (stellar) mass function in order to determine the characteristic mass of an SF galaxy: we find that since z $\sim$ 3 the majority of all new stars were always formed in galaxies of M${_\ast}$ = 1010.6$\pm$0.4 M . In this sense, too, there is no ``downsizing.'' Finally, our analysis constitutes the most extensive SFR density determination with a single technique out to z = 3. Recent Herschel results are consistent with our results, but rely on far smaller samples.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed the bivariate distribution of galaxies as a function of ultraviolet-optical colors and absolute magnitudes in the local universe. The sample consists of galaxies with redshifts and optical photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample matched with detections in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) and far-ultraviolet (FUV ) bands in the Medium Imaging Survey being carried out by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX ) satellite. In the ( NUV \`A r)0:1 versus Mr;0:1 galaxy color-magnitude diagram, the galaxies separate into two well-defined blue and red sequences. The ( NUV \`A r)0:1 color distribution at each Mr;0:1 is not well fit by the sum of two Gaussians due to an excess of galaxies in between the two sequences. The peaks of both sequences become redder with increasing luminosity, with a distinct blue peak visible up to Mr;0:1 \$ \`A23. The r0:1-band luminosity functions vary systematically with color, with the faint-end slope and characteristic luminosity gradually increasing with color. After correcting for attenuation due to dust, we find that approximately one-quarter of the color variation along the blue sequence is due to dust, with the remainder due to star formation history and metallicity. Finally, we present the distribution of galaxies as a function of specific star formation rate and stellar mass. The specific star formation rates imply that galaxies along the blue sequence progress from low-mass galaxies with star formation rates that increase somewhat with time to more massive galaxies with a more or less constant star formation rate. Above a stellar mass of \$1010.5 M , galaxies with low ratios of current to past averaged star formation rate begin to dominate.},

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the e\textdagger{}ects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the in\~Nuence of the \DH{}nite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Ha to Hb luminosities, the Ha equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the \DH{}nite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we \DH{}nd that an e\textdagger{}ective absorption curve proportional to j\textasciitilde{}0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the e\textdagger{}ective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we \DH{}nd that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe : use an e\textdagger{}ective absorption curve proportional to j\textasciitilde{}0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

With a spectral coverage of 3622\textendash{}10354 \AA{} and an average footprint of $\sim$500 arcsec2 per IFU the scientific data products derived from MaNGA will permit exploration of the internal structure of a statistically large sample of 10,000 low-redshift galaxies in unprecedented detail. Comprising 174 individually pluggable science and calibration IFUs with a near-constant data stream, MaNGA is expected to obtain $\sim$100 million raw-frame spectra and $\sim$10 million reduced galaxy spectra over the six-year lifetime of the survey. In this contribution, we describe the MaNGA Data Reduction Pipeline algorithms and centralized metadata framework that produce skysubtracted spectrophotometrically calibrated spectra and rectified three-dimensional data cubes that combine individual dithered observations. For the 1390 galaxy data cubes released in Summer 2016 as part of SDSS-IV Data Release 13, we demonstrate that the MaNGA data have nearly Poisson-limited sky subtraction shortward of $\sim$8500 \AA{} and reach a typical 10$\sigma$ limiting continuum surface brightness $\mu$ï =ï 23.5 AB arcsec-2 in a five-arcseconddiameter aperture in the g-band. The wavelength calibration of the MaNGA data is accurate to 5 km s-1 rms, with a median spatial resolution of 2.54 arcsec FWHM (1.8 kpc at the median redshift of 0.037) and a median spectral resolution of $\sigma$ï =ï 72 km s-1.},

  abstract = {We present the design and performance of the multi-object fiber spectrographs for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade for the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally commissioned in Fall 1999 on the 2.5 m aperture Sloan Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the spectrographs produced more than 1.5 million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II surveys, enabling a wide variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science including the first observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The spectrographs were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the flagship survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Ly$\alpha$ absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 deg2 of sky, making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic distance scale of the universe and placing tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. The twin multi-object fiber spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout with reflective collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and state-of-the-art CCD detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in two channels over a bandpass covering the near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared, with a resolving power R = $\lambda$/FWHM $\sim$ 2000. Building on proven heritage, the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase holographic gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 nm $<$ $\lambda$ $<$ 1000 nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to 1000 per exposure. In this paper we describe the original SDSS spectrograph design and the upgrades implemented for BOSS, and document the predicted and measured performances.},

Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGNsï and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5 m Sloan Foundation Telescope at theï Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020.

  abstract = {The construction of detailed models for intermediate and old stellar populations is described. Input parameters include metallicity (-2 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.5), single-burst age (between 1.5 and 17 Gyr), and initial mass function (IMF) exponent. Quantities output include broadband magnitudes, spectral energy distributions, surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes, and a suite of 21 absorption feature indices. The models are checked against a wide variety of available observations. Examinations of model output yield the following conclusions. ( 1 ) If the percentage change Aage/AZ \ae{} 3/2 for two populations, they will appear almost identical in most indices. A few indices break this degeneracy by being either more abundance sensitive (Fe4668, Fe5015, Fe5709, and Fe5782) or more age sensitive (G4300, H\ss, and presumably higher order Balmer lines) than usual. (2) Present uncertainties in stellar evolution are of the same magnitude as the effects of IMF and Y in the indices studied. ( 3 ) Changes in abundance ratios (like [Mg/Fe]) are predicted to be readily apparent in the spectra of old stellar populations. (4) The /-band flux of a stellar population is predicted to be nearly independent of metallicity and only modestly sensitive to age. The / band is therefore recommended for standard candle work or studies of M/L in galaxies. Other conclusions stem from this work. ( 1 ) Intercomparison of models and observations of two TiO indices seem to indicate variation of the [ V/Ti] ratio among galaxies, but it is not clear how this observation ties into the standard picture of chemical enrichment. (2) Current estimates of [Fe/H] for the most metal-rich globulars that are based on integrated indices are probably slightly too high. ( 3 ) Colors of population models from different authors exhibit a substantial range. At solar metallicity and 13 Gyr, this range corresponds to an age error of roughly $\pm$7 Gyr. Model colors from different authors applied in a differential sense have smaller uncertainties. (4) In the present models the dominant error for colors is probably the transformation from stellar atmospheric parameters to stellar colors. ( 5 ) Stellar B \textemdash{} V is difficult to model, and current spreads among different authors can reach 0.2 mag. ( 6 ) If known defects in the stellar flux library are corrected, the population model colors of this work in passbands redder than U would be accurate to roughly 0.03 mag in an absolute sense. These corrections are not made in the tables of model output.},

  abstract = {We develop a new method to constrain the star formation histories, dust attenuation and stellar masses of galaxies. It is based on two stellar absorption-line indices, the 4000-A\r{} break strength and the Balmer absorption-line index H$\delta$ A. Together, these indices allow us to constrain the mean stellar ages of galaxies and the fractional stellar mass formed in bursts over the past few Gyr. A comparison with broad-band photometry then yields estimates of dust attenuation and of stellar mass. We generate a large library of Monte Carlo realizations of different star formation histories, including starbursts of varying strength and a range of metallicities. We use this library to generate median likelihood estimates of burst mass fractions, dust attenuation strengths, stellar masses and stellar mass-to-light ratios for a sample of 122 808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The typical 95 per cent confidence range in our estimated stellar masses is $\pm$40 per cent. We study how the stellar mass-to-light ratios of galaxies vary as a function of absolute magnitude, concentration index and photometric passband and how dust attenuation varies as a function of absolute magnitude and 4000-A\r{} break strength. We also calculate how the total stellar mass of the present Universe is distributed over galaxies as a function of their mass, size, concentration, colour, burst mass fraction and surface mass density. We find that most of the stellar mass in the local Universe resides in galaxies that have, to within a factor of approximately 2, stellar masses $\sim$5\texttimes{} 1010 M , half-light radii $\sim$3 kpc and half-light surface mass densities $\sim$109 M kpc-2. The distribution of Dn(4000) is strongly bimodal, showing a clear division between galaxies dominated by old stellar populations and galaxies with more recent star formation.},

  abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and $\pm$500 km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between lowand high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M${_\ast}$ $<$ 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M , where M${_\ast}$ = stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010\textendash{}3 \texttimes{} 1010 M , the median SFR/M${_\ast}$ decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [O III] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales: the $\lambda$4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index H$\delta$A, and the specific SFR/M${_\ast}$. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long ($>$1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 \texttimes{} 1010 M , the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH\textendash{}density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A\r{} to 160 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour\textendash{}magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data.},

  abstract = {We observed Hubble Deep Field South with the new panoramic integral-field spectrograph MUSE that we built and have just commissioned at the VLT. The data cube resulting from 27 h of integration covers one arcmin2 field of view at an unprecedented depth with a 1$\sigma$ emission-line surface brightness limit of 1 \texttimes{} 10-19 erg s-1 cm-2 arcsec-2, and contains $\sim$90 000 spectra. We present the combined and calibrated data cube, and we performed a first-pass analysis of the sources detected in the Hubble Deep Field South imaging. We measured the redshifts of 189 sources up to a magnitude I814 = 29.5, increasing the number of known spectroscopic redshifts in this field by more than an order of magnitude. We also discovered 26 Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies that are not detected in the HST WFPC2 deep broad-band images. The intermediate spectral resolution of 2.3 \AA{} allows us to separate resolved asymmetric Ly$\alpha$ emitters, [O ï©ï©]3727 emitters, and C ï©ï©ï©]1908 emitters, and the broad instantaneous wavelength range of 4500 \AA{} helps to identify single emission lines, such as [O ï©ï©ï©]5007, H$\beta$, and H$\alpha$, over a very wide redshift range. We also show how the three-dimensional information of MUSE helps to resolve sources that are confused at ground-based image quality. Overall, secure identifications are provided for 83\% of the 227 emission line sources detected in the MUSE data cube and for 32\% of the 586 sources identified in the HST catalogue. The overall redshift distribution is fairly flat to z = 6.3, with a reduction between z = 1.5 to 2.9, in the well-known redshift desert. The field of view of MUSE also allowed us to detect 17 groups within the field. We checked that the number counts of [O ï©ï©]3727 and Ly$\alpha$ emitters are roughly consistent with predictions from the literature. Using two examples, we demonstrate that MUSE is able to provide exquisite spatially resolved spectroscopic information on the intermediate-redshift galaxies present in the field. This unique data set can be used for a wide range of follow-up studies. We release the data cube, the associated products, and the source catalogue with redshifts, spectra, and emission-line fluxes.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A\r{} to 160 $\mathrm{\mu}$m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour\textendash{}magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy\textemdash{}disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters\textemdash{}and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m տ 1 M, and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around mc $\sim$ 0.08 M, and a variance in logarithmic mass j $\sim$ 0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has mc $\sim$ 0.2 M, and j $\sim$ 0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of Land T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, nBD $\sim$ n${_\ast}$ $\sim$ 0.1 pcϪ3. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages տ130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, mc $\sim$ 0.2\textendash{}0.3 M,, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below $\sim$1 M,. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.},

A robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxy spectra is described and used to explore the behavior of PAH emission and the prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is found in \$81 of the sample, at strengths that indicate that most normal galaxies undergo AV P 3 mag averaged over their centers. The contribution of PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10\% and extend up to \$20\% and is suppressed at metallicities Z P Z /4, as well as in low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong interband PAH feature strength variations (2Y5 times) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5Y8  m features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z \textonequarter{} 0Y2:5.},

  abstract = {Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) is an integral-field spectroscopic survey that is one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV). MaNGA's 17 pluggable optical fiber-bundle integral field units (IFUs) will observe a sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies distributed throughout the SDSS imaging footprint (focusing particularly on the North Galactic Cap). In each pointing these IFUs are deployed across a 3$^\circ$ field; they yield spectral coverage 3600-10300 \AA{} at a typical resolution R $\sim$ 2000, and sample the sky with 2${''}$ diameter fiber apertures with a total bundle fill factor of 56\%. Observing over such a large field and range of wavelengths is particularly challenging for obtaining uniform and integral spatial coverage and resolution at all wavelengths and across each entire fiber array. Data quality is affected by the IFU construction technique, chromatic and field differential refraction, the adopted dithering strategy, and many other effects. We use numerical simulations to constrain the hardware design and observing strategy for the survey with the aim of ensuring consistent data quality that meets the survey science requirements while permitting maximum observational flexibility. We find that MaNGA science goals are best achieved with IFUs composed of a regular hexagonal grid of optical fibers with rms displacement of 5 $\mu$m or less from their nominal packing position; this goal is met by the MaNGA hardware, which achieves 3 $\mu$m rms fiber placement. We further show that MaNGA observations are best obtained in sets of three 15 minute exposures dithered along the vertices of a 1.44 arcsec equilateral triangle; these sets form the minimum observational unit, and are repeated as needed to achieve a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 5 \AA{}-1 per fiber in the r-band continuum at a surface brightness of 23 AB arcsec-2. In order to ensure uniform coverage and delivered image quality, we require that the exposures in a given set be obtained within a 60 minute interval of each other in hour angle, and that all exposures be obtained at airmass 1.2 (i.e., within 1\textendash{}3 hr of transit depending on the declination of a given field).},

  abstract = {We describe the sample design for the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey and present the final properties of the main samples along with important considerations for using these samples for science. Our target selection criteria were developed while simultaneously optimizing the size distribution of the MaNGA integral field units (IFUs), the IFU allocation strategy, and the target density to produce a survey defined in terms of maximizing signal-to-noise ratio, spatial resolution, and sample size. Our selection strategy makes use of redshift limits that only depend on i-band absolute magnitude (Mi), or, for a small subset of our sample, Miand color (NUV - i). Such a strategy ensures that all galaxies span the same range in angular size irrespective of luminosity and are therefore covered evenly by the adopted range of IFU sizes. We define three samples: the Primary and Secondary samples are selected to have a flat number density with respect to Miand are targeted to have spectroscopic coverage to 1.5 and 2.5 effective radii (Re), respectively. The Color-Enhanced supplement increases the number of galaxies in the low-density regions of color\textendash{}magnitude space by extending the redshift limits of the Primary sample in the appropriate color bins. The samples cover the stellar mass range 5 \textasciiacute{} 108  M*  3 \textasciiacute{} 1011 M h-2 and are sampled at median physical resolutions of 1.37 and 2.5 kpc for the Primary and Secondary samples, respectively. We provide weights that will statistically correct for our luminosity and color-dependent selection function and IFU allocation strategy, thus correcting the observed sample to a volume-limited sample.},

  abstract = {For 21 Sc galaxies whose properties encompass a wide range of radii, masses, and luminosities, we have obtained major axis spectra extending to the faint outer regions, and have deduced rotation curves. The galaxies are of high inclination, so uncertainties in the angle of inclination to the line of sight and in the position angle of the major axis are minimized. Their radii range from 4 to 122 kpc (7/ = 50 km s-1 Mpc-1); in general, the rotation curves extend to 83\% of R25l,b- When plotted on a linear scale with no scaling, the rotation curves for the smallest galaxies fall upon the initial parts of the rotation curves for the larger galaxies. All curves show a fairly rapid velocity rise to K \^ 125 km s\_1 at R \textasciitilde{} 5 kpc, and a slower rise thereafter. Most rotation curves are rising slowly even at the farthest measured point. Neither high nor low luminosity Sc galaxies have falling rotation curves. Sc galaxies of all luminosities must have significant mass located beyond the optical image. A linear relation between log Kmax and log R follows from the shape of the common rotation curve for all Sc's, and the tendency of smaller galaxies, at any R, to have lower velocities than the large galaxies at that R. The significantly shallower slope discovered for this relation by Tully and Fisher is attributed to their use of galaxies of various Hubble types and the known correlation of Kmax with Hubble type.},

  abstract={We use high-resolution N -body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.}

  abstract={We measure the star formation efficiency (SFE), the star formation rate (SFR) per unit of gas, in 23 nearby galaxies and compare it with expectations from proposed star formation laws and thresholds. We use H I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) and derive H 2 maps of CO measured by HERA CO-Line Extragalactic Survey and Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We estimate the SFR by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer ( GALEX ) far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from SINGS 3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from THINGS. We measure the SFE as a function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure, stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars), the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H 2 alone is nearly constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10 –10 yr –1 (equivalent to an H 2 depletion time of 1.9 × 10 9 yr) as a function of all of these variables at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium (ISM) is mostly H I , however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential with scale length 0.2 r 25 -0.25 r 25 . We interpret this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC) formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure spanning from the H 2 -dominated to H I -dominated ISM. The radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I , H 2 formation and destruction, and stellar feedback—governs the formation of GMCs from H I .}
